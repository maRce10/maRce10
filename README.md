 ðŸ‘‹ I am an evolutionary behavioral ecologist, that ended up doing a lot of coding just to be able to customize my data analyses

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on several projects, including:
  - [an R package (*ohun*) to access nature media files from online repositories](https://github.com/maRce10/suwo)  
  - [another R package (*PhenotypeSpace*) for quantifying phenotypic trait spaces](https://marce10.github.io/PhenotypeSpace/)
  - [another R package (*brmsish*) with miscellaneous functions to customize brms regression models ](https://marce10.github.io/brmsish/)
