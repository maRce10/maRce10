 👋 I am an evolutionary behavioral ecologist, that ended up doing a lot of coding just to be able to customize my data analyses

I use github to make my research reproducible by sharing the data and code of my projects (most of my repos are research projects). I also use it to develop and maintain several R packages:

[![:name status badge](https://maRce10.r-universe.dev/badges/:name)](https://maRce10.r-universe.dev)

| Package | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| [baRulho](https://github.com/ropensci/baRulho) | Aims to facilitate the implementation of (animal) sound transmission experiments from playback design to degradation quantification |
| [brmsish](https://github.com/maRce10/brmsish) | Custom manipulation of brms bayesian models that I like (not sure if this should be a true package!) |
| [dynaSpec](https://github.com/maRce10/dynaSpec) | Create dynamic visualizations of sound (spectrogram movies) |
| [NatureSounds](https://github.com/maRce10/NatureSounds) | Examples of natural acoustic data |
| [ohun](https://github.com/ropensci/ohun) | Optimize sound event detection |
| [Rraven](https://github.com/maRce10/Rraven) | Connecting R and Raven sound analysis software |
| [PhenotypeSpace](https://github.com/maRce10/PhenotypeSpace) | Quantify multivariate phenotypic spaces (under development) |
| [suwo](https://github.com/maRce10/suwo) | Access nature media repositories |
| [warbleR](https://github.com/maRce10/warbleR) | Quantify the structure of animal acoustic signals |
