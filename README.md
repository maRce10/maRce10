 👋 I am an evolutionary behavioral ecologist, that ended up doing a lot of coding just to be able to customize my data analyses

🔭 I’m currently working on several projects, including:
  - [an R package (*ohun*) to access nature media files](https://github.com/maRce10/suwo) from online repositories 
  - [another R package (*PhenotypeSpace*) for quantifying phenotypic trait spaces]([https://github.com/maRce10/suwo](https://marce10.github.io/PhenotypeSpace/)) 
  - [another R package (*brmsish*) with miscellaneous functions to customize brms regression models ]([https://github.com/maRce10/brmsish](https://marce10.github.io/brmsish/))
